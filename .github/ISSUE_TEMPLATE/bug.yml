        ***DO NOT EXPECT A QUICK REPLY OR RESOLUTION***
        This project is done purely in my spare time, and months can go by before I do have some.
        Do not ask for update, just be patient and wait for me to get to it.

        Some stats base on previous 400 bugs:
        * Usual time to first response: between 45 to 131 days
        * Usual time to resolution: between 132 to 476 days
